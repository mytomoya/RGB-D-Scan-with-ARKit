When the `Show Point Cloud` button is on, the app shows the point cloud of the scnene instead of Camera Image.

| Camera Image | Depth Map | Confidence Map | Point Cloud |
|:------------:|:---------:|:--------------:|:-----------:|
| <img src="./images/rgb.PNG" width="200"> | <img src="./images/depth.PNG" width="200"> | <img src="./images/confidence.PNG" width="200">| <img src="./images/point_cloud.PNG" width="200"> | 


## How to Save Point Cloud

After scanning, tap the `Save` button on the bottom left of the app to save the point cloud as a `.ply` file. 

The point cloud is generated by projecting the pixels of the current frame onto the 3D space using the depth map, camera intrinsic and view matrix.


## Structure of the Saved Data

The saved data is stored under the `Documents` directory of the `ScanRGB` app. The directory structure is as follows:

```
.
├── 1/
│   ├── Confidence/
│   │   ├── confidence_0.jpg
│   │   ├── confidence_1.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Frame/
│   │   ├── frame_0.json
│   │   ├── frame_1.json
│   │   └── ...
│   └── RGB/
│       ├── rgb_0.jpg
│       ├── rgb_1.jpg
│       └── ...
└── 2/
    ├── Confidence/
    ├── Frame/
    └── RGB/
```

`frame_n.json` contains the following information for the `n`-th frame:

```json
{
    "depth_map": {
        "width": "width of the depth map",
        "height": "height of the depth map",
        "values": [
            "depth map values flattened into a 1D array"
        ]
    },
    "intrinsic": [
        "3 x 3 camera intrinsic matrix"
    ],
    "view_matrix": [
        "4 x 4 view matrix"
    ],
    "frame_number": "frame number"
}
```


## Known Issues

- The number of saved frames shown on the top left of the app is not accurate. Sometimes it shows a larger number than the actual number of saved frames.
